	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install neovim

Next you should create a custom vimrc file for it - see :help nvim-from-vim.

It will tell you that you should execute (:) the following from within nvim.

	:call mkdir(stdpath('config'), 'p')
	:exe 'edit '.stdpath('config').'/init.vim'
	
Then copy in the following piece of code, which will ensure that your normal .vimrc file is loaded. So you don't have to manage that second configuration except it really is a nvim specific configuration.

	set runtimepath^=~/.vim runtimepath+=~/.vim/after
	let &packpath = &runtimepath
	source ~/.vimrc

This file will be located under ~/.config/nvim/init.vim.
